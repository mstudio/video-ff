# YT Ad blocker Chrome Extension

Skips the video ads on YouTube. Clicks on the skip button.

## Installation

The "Fast Forward" button will appear on the top right corner of the browser. If it doesn't click on the extensions icon (puzzle piece) in the top right corner of the browser and pin the extension.

## Map a Hotkey

In the extensions page on Chrome, scroll to the bottom and click on "Keyboard shortcuts". Map a hotkey to the extension "Fast Forward". For example, I mapped it to **⌘→**.
